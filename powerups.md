# Powerups
- General logic is to have small hitbox around, disappears on pickup, gives buff to player who picks it up
    - Maybe we can have buffs that are given to all players
    - Maybe powerups will "expire" after some time (i.e. 20s)


## Generic
- Speed up (coffee, or boots)
- HP buff (heart)
- Invincibility (star)

- How to handle generic vs class specific powerups? Maybe same powerup icon does different effect based on who picks it up?

## Animal Rescue
- Magnet (might be too complex)
    - Draw animals closer to player, or corral
- Lasso to increase range of animal pickup?
- Powerup to interact with idea of birds/fish movement
    - Enable it, or maybe increase efficacy/range of it?

## Firefighter
- Range up (length)
- Range up (width)
- "Damage" (to fire, or special events)
- Nozzle change -> shotgun spray? (sidegrade)
- Full screen fire wipe (spray screen)
